CESM2.X on ARC4
===================================

The Community Earth System Model (`CESM <https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/>'_) is a coupled climate model. It has seven different components: atmosphere, ocean, river run off, sea ice, land ice. The Common Infrastructure for Modeling the Earth (CIME) is a python based tool for coupling these different aspects together. The latest release is CESM 2.1.3 using CIME 5.6. A pre-release of CESM 2.2.0 using CIME 5.8 is also currently available. Both are in the process of being ported to ARC4.  

Advanced Research Computing node 4 (`ARC4 <https://arcdocs.leeds.ac.uk/welcome.html>'_) is the high performance computing facilities provided by the Research Computing group at the University of Leeds.

.. note::

  Both CESM 2.1.3 and CESM 2.2.0 are in the process of being ported to ARC4 by CEMAC. If you want use of the model, please contact CEMAC.
